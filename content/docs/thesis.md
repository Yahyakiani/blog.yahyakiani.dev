## **September 25, 2023: Idea Formulation**

### **Potential Research Avenues**

At the outset, several topics within early childhood language development (0-5 years old) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) presented themselves:

1. **NLP Milestones for Children**: A deep dive into how children aged 0-5 interact with and benefit from NLP tools in Nova Scotia.
2. **Speech Recognition Tools for Early Intervention**: Exploring the potential of NLP tools in identifying speech and language developmental delays.
3. **NLP-Assisted Support for Language Delays**: The design and efficiency of NLP applications specifically tailored for children with identified speech impediments.
4. **Autism and NLP**: Investigating how speech patterns of children aged 0-5 might serve as early indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and how NLP tools might facilitate early detection.

### **Final Selection**

To be determined after discussions with my supervisor Professor Lizbeth Escobedo.

## October 2, 2023: Diving Deeper

### Research Focus

After thorough discussions with my supervisor, Professor Lizbeth Escobedo, I've made a decision. The area I've chosen to delve into is:

**NLP Tools as an Aid for Children with Language Delays**  
**Research Question**: How can NLP-powered applications be designed to support children in Nova Scotia with identified speech and language delays?

### Literature Review Underway

To gain a comprehensive understanding of this topic, I've started an extensive literature review. This entails reading various scholarly papers and articles that shed light on the intersection of NLP and early childhood language development.

Several key themes and niche subjects in this regard that are emerging:

1. **Impact of NLP in Speech Therapy**: How have NLP tools been utilized in speech therapy sessions and what has been the outcome for children with speech delays?
2. **Design Principles for Child-Friendly NLP Tools**: What considerations need to be made to ensure NLP tools are both effective and engaging for young children?
3. **Ethical Implications**: With the use of technology in early childhood, what are the ethical considerations, especially when dealing with vulnerable groups such as children with language delays?
4. **Regional Nuances**: Since the focus is on children in Nova Scotia, are there any regional-specific speech patterns or challenges that need to be addressed by NLP tools?

### Collaboration on the Horizon

Considering the deep involvement of NLP in this research, there's a possibility of bringing a co-supervisor on board. This would provide additional expertise, particularly in the technical aspects of NLP, ensuring the research is both rigorous and innovative.
