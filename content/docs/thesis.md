## **September 25, 2023: Idea Formulation**

### **Potential Research Avenues**

At the outset, several topics within early childhood language development (0-5 years old) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) presented themselves:

1. **NLP Milestones for Children**: A deep dive into how children aged 0-5 interact with and benefit from NLP tools in Nova Scotia.
2. **Speech Recognition Tools for Early Intervention**: Exploring the potential of NLP tools in identifying speech and language developmental delays.
3. **NLP-Assisted Support for Language Delays**: The design and efficiency of NLP applications specifically tailored for children with identified speech impediments.
4. **Autism and NLP**: Investigating how speech patterns of children aged 0-5 might serve as early indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and how NLP tools might facilitate early detection.

### **Final Selection**

To be determined after discussions with my supervisor Professor Lizbeth Escobedo.
