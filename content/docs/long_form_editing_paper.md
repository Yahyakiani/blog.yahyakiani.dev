## **September 23, 2023: Embarking on Model Editing Evaluation**

### **Research Leadership**

This research endeavor is spearheaded by [Domenic Rosati](https://github.com/domenicrosati). Domenic is pivotal in bringing this project to fruition and bringing the team up to speed. Collaborating closely with him on this initiative are Yahya(Me), Melis, and Deepika.


### **Research Objective**

The primary aim of this project is to establish a framework for assessing paragraph-length generations from edited large language models. As the capabilities of large language models grow, so does the importance of understanding their behavior, especially when edited.

### **Collaborative Effort**

This research is a collaborative initiative involving:

- Domenic, Yahya, Deepika, Melis.
- Supervisors: Lizbeth Escobedo, Hassan Sajjad, Frank Rudzicz
- External Collaborators: Jason (from Counterfact+ dataset), Andrew

Relevant Resources:
- [Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5187924/long-form-model-edit-eval)
- [Overleaf Paper Draft](https://www.overleaf.com/4737549179znvrxghfcyqg)
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/domenicrosati/longform_edit_model_evals)

### **Initial Steps**

Our first task was to design a 10-passage survey aimed at discerning various properties and values related to model editing. The design specifics and outcomes of this survey will be detailed in the next update.

### **Resources & Readings**

As we dive into this project, several readings and resources have been identified to lay a strong foundation:
- Basics: An understanding of neural networks, transformers, tokens, and more.
- Papers: From understanding the risks posed by language models to evaluating the ripple effects of knowledge editing.
