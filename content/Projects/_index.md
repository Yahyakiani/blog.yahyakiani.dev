        <h3>Awesome CV</h3>
        <p>Awesome CV is LaTeX template for a CV(Curriculum Vitae), Résumé or Cover Letter. I loved the look of this project. Although, it was non-functional when I came across this project. I knew little to nothing about latex and it's working at the time, I was excited to fix the error-prone cv maker. After much trial and errors, I finally found that the cv compilation broke down because of path difference in file imports on Windows Operating systems.</p>
